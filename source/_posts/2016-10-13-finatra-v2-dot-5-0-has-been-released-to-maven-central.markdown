###  Finatra [release 2.5.0](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/releases/tag/finatra-2.5.0) is now available from [Maven Central][maven-central].

Some of the changes in the latest releases:

- We've [upgraded to Jackson 2.8.3](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/e8e7837a9c79f67dac40ce21ef361104edcf99d7)!
- We've [*mostly* removed](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/73158b8295e861390123e2abf373aea251f3841c) the need of the `maven.twttr.com` sbt resolver. It's still necessary to resolve specific Twitter thrift dependencies.
- We [fixed](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/152d43dd56e88b37770e0271cbc057203b7106df) an [issue with missing files](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/issues/357) in the finatra-jackson test jar. Classes in the test `c.t.finatra.validation` package were not properly marked for 
  inclusion.
- SLFJ4 bridge installation has [changed](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/807d22f5783b057341d4149b305d533d5bd4b4ec) to occur earlier and capture more of the bridged logging.
- Simplified ExceptionMapper usage. Please read the [commit notes](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/36afd2c4f0dfa29108e336bdd60a534a414a9a28) as this is a breaking change.
- We've [added](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/commit/1ef8c997fd43c3bbf8220dfc94dd64e4674d22b6) support for "dark traffic filtering" in finatra-http.
